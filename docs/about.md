# About the CoPilot Metadata Site

This site stores resources to help TigerGraph CoPilot users to create
and manage metadata that are associated with a TigerGraph CoPilot application.

The key functions include:

1. Creating a list of personas that will use the application
2. For each persona, generate a list of the key questions asked by this role
3. Create definitions for key data elements including graphs, nodes, edges, attributes and enumerated values
