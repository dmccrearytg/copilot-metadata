# CoPilot Application Fraud Personas and Questions

### Personas Respons

For your credit card application fraud detection system, which leverages complex relationships and graph algorithms via TigerGraph, several key personas would interact with a chatbot to ask questions about the data. Here are the top personas focused on the operational and analytical aspects of the system:

1.  **Fraud Analyst**:
    -   Role: Monitors and investigates suspicious activities and anomalies detected by the system.
    -   Chatbot Use: Queries specific transaction details, asks for patterns related to certain attributes (like IP addresses or devices), and requests historical fraud trends.
2.  **Compliance Officer**:
    -   Role: Ensures that the fraud detection processes comply with regulatory requirements.
    -   Chatbot Use: Seeks reports on compliance metrics, asks about data handling practices, and queries for audit trails of fraud investigations.
3.  **Risk Manager**:
    -   Role: Oversees the overall risk management related to credit card applications.
    -   Chatbot Use: Inquires about high-risk profiles, asks for risk exposure levels across different regions or products, and queries the impact of new fraud trends on overall risk.
4.  **Customer Support Representative**:
    -   Role: Assists customers who are potentially affected by fraud.
    -   Chatbot Use: Verifies customer account activity, checks status of fraud investigations related to specific customer cases, and queries information to respond to customer inquiries about suspicious activities.
5.  **Data Scientist**:
    -   Role: Analyzes and refines fraud detection models to improve accuracy.
    -   Chatbot Use: Requests data extracts for model training, queries correlations and statistical summaries, and checks the performance metrics of current fraud detection models.
6.  **Operations Manager**:
    -   Role: Manages the day-to-day operations and ensures the efficiency of the fraud detection process.
    -   Chatbot Use: Looks for operational metrics, queries system throughput and processing times, and asks for updates on the status of ongoing fraud cases.

These personas would utilize a chatbot to interact with the system efficiently, allowing for quick access to data, thereby enabling them to make informed decisions and take timely actions against fraudulent activities.
