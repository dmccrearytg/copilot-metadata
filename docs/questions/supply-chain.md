# Supply Chain

## Application Description

Supply chain management is full of dependencies: a product is the result of hundreds of upstream components and processes fulfilling their requirements.  Unfortunately, manufacturers (and other businesses that have multiple levels of inputs contributing to the final outputs) often cannot get basic reports on the bill of materials, timeliness and efficiency, because their information is spread across too many systems, or the systems are poor at working with dependencies.  A graph-based operational digital twin of a supply chain can solve these problems. The graph excels at modeling dependencies. Not only does it show you the current state of your supply chain (observability), but it can simulate operations, to help you respond agilely to shocks and to make preemptive changes to improve supply chain resiliency.
Observability and monitoring: 
Tracing impact and root causes: When a particular component/supply/region is disrupted and can't be fixed immediately, the business needs to be able to trace downstream to see what will be affected. A graph-based digital twin can show and report on downstream effects using a Directed Breadth-First Search.  Similarly, the digital twin can trace upstream to see what are the possible root causes of a defect.
Identifying alternatives: 
Assessing risks and improving resiliency: Supply change shocks and disruptions WILL occur, but well-prepared businesses work to minimize both the likelihood and impact of disruptions. Algorithms such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality can identify the riskiest stages of a supply chain.
