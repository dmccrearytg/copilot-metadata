Mule Account Detection,"Mule account detection in financial crime is a critical endeavor aimed at identifying bank accounts that are used to receive and disperse money from illicit activities. These mule accounts, which may be involved either knowingly or unknowingly in these operations, present a significant challenge for financial institutions. The rapid movement of funds through an extensive and seemingly unconnected network of accounts, spread across numerous financial institutions, complicates the tracking and halting of such illicit transactions. Financial institutions are therefore tasked with detecting this activity promptly to prevent further fund transfer and ensure the return of assets to their rightful owners. TigerGraph's solutions address this challenge through a suite of sophisticated graph algorithms that enable real-time monitoring, feature engineering for machine learning, and anomaly detection to trace illegal funds effectively. Community Detection is employed to unveil clusters within the transaction network, highlighting groups of accounts that work in concert to move illicit funds. The Centrality (PageRank) algorithm identifies key accounts that act as central nodes in the distribution network, crucial for disrupting the flow of illicit money. Closeness (Shortest Path) analysis reveals the most direct routes for money laundering, aiding in the trace back to the source. Lastly, Deep Link Analysis uncovers hidden connections between accounts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the network's structure and operation. Together, these algorithms form the backbone of TigerGraph's approach to dismantling the complex networks of mule accounts, safeguarding the financial system against the movement of illicit funds.",Q2 - Currently available,"Weighted WCC

Supply Chain Management,"Supply chain management is fully of dependencies: a product is the result of hundreds of upstream components and processes fulfilling their requirements.  Unfortunately, manufacturers (and other business that have multiple levels of inputs contributing to the final outputs) often cannot get basic reports on bill of materials, timeliness and efficiency, because their information is spread across too many systems, or the systems are poor at working with dependencies.  A graph-based operational digital twin of a supply chain can solve these problems. The graph excels at modeling dependencies. Not only does it show you the current state of your supply chain (observability), but it can simulate operations, to help you response agilely to shocks and to make preemptive changes to improve supply chain resiliency.
Observability and monitoring: 
Tracing impact and root causes: When a particular component/supply/region is disrupted and can't be fixed immeditately, the business needs to be able to trace downstream to see what will be affected. A graph-based digital twin can show and report on downstream effects using Directed Breadth First Search.  Similarly, the digital twin can trace upstream to see what are the possible root causes of a defect.
Identifying alternatives: 
Assessing risks and improving resiliency: Supply change shocks and disruptions WILL occur, but well-prepared businesses work to minimize both the likelihood and impact of disruptions. Algorithms such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality can identity the riskiest stages of a supply chain.",Q2,"Betweenness Centrality
